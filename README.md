### [Description](#table-of-contents)
I was posed with the task of re-imagining my portfolio using react. In this project I was able to dynamically render pages using react-router / react-router-dom. I was also able to use "useState" to reuse code, while making each page specific to the content.  Lastly I used a number of different effects to make this page more visually appealing, and up to date with more modern technologies. This project was not without it's trials and tribulations. I may have spent more time in getting this deployed than actually building the site itself. I learned so much about how the react-router/router-dom works, and what you need to do in order to deploy a routed page. I also spent quite a bit of time learning how to embed a pdf to the page, and getting it to display on the GH-Pages site.
